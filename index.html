                JavaScript Made Simple's objective is to bring awareness about JavaScript to the novice developer. This
                site will highlight the some of the basic attributes of JavaScript, as well as, provide some external
                links for a better understanding of how JavaScript works.

                            A JavaScript function is a JavaScript procedure where a set of statements that performs a
                            task or calculates a value. To use this function you must define the value of the function
                            and then invoke, or call, the function.

                        <p>
                            In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a
                            cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight,
                            a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which
                            define their characteristics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be
                            explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the
                            same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties
                            of an object define the characteristics of the object.
                        </p>
                        Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation. Objects
                        are sometimes called associative arrays, since each property is associated with a string value
                        that can be used to access it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything that can be
                            converted to a string, including the empty string. However, any property name that is not a
                            valid JavaScript identifier (for example, a property name that has a space or a hyphen, or
                            that starts with a number) can only be accessed using the square bracket notation. This
                            notation is also very useful when property names are to be dynamically determined (when the
                            property name is not determined until runtime).

                            An array is an ordered set of values that you refer to with a name and an index. For
                            example, you could have an array called emp that contains employees' names indexed by their
                            numerical employee number. So emp[1] would be employee number one, emp[2] employee number
                            two, and so on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript does not have an explicit array data type. However, you can use the predefined
                            Array object and its methods to work with arrays in your applications. The Array object has
                            methods for manipulating arrays in various ways, such as joining, reversing, and sorting
                            them. It has a property for determining the array length and other properties for use with
                            regular expressions.
